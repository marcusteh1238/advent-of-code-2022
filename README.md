# Introduction

This repository is made for the purpose of documenting my progress through [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I will probably be doing everything in NodeJS but we'll see how it goes!

To make it easier to keep track of, there will be a folder for each puzzle of the event. Maybe I'll add notes about how I came to a solution if I have the energy or time?

# Current Progress

# Setup

To test different inputs, make sure there is an `input.txt` file in the folder and write the input you want to test in there.
